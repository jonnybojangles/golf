Light, more light -- Hole 2.
===
The second hole is no breather hole either as the golfer is confronted with Out of Bounds looming on the entire left side of the hole. Play for direction not distance off of this tee box, as tall fescues bordering the right side of the fairway make accuracy a must. The green is average in size and relatively flat. Beware of the deep bunker to the back left of the green.

## Problem Description
There is man named Mabu who switches on-off the lights along a corridor at our university. Every bulb has its own toggle switch that changes the state of the light. If the light is off, pressing the switch turns it on. Pressing it again will turn it off. Initially each bulb is off.

He does a peculiar thing. If there are *n* bulbs in a corridor, he walks along the corridor back and forth *n* times. On the *i*-th walk, he toggles only the switches whose position is divisible by *i*. He does not press any switch when coming back to his initial position. The *i*th walk is defined as going down the corridor (doing his peculiar thing) and coming back again. Determine the final state of the last bulb. Is it on or off?

## Input

The input will be an integer indicating the *n*th bulb in a corridor: 

### Sample Input:
<code>
input = [
	1,
	2,
	8250,
	3910,
	1930,
	256,
	1321,
	8447,
	1969,
	6444,
	4926,
	3845
];
</code>

## Output 
"yes" or "no" to indicate if the light is on, with each case appearing on its own line.

## Sample Input

3

6241

8191

## Sample Output

no

yes

no

## Entry
Clone or Fork. Rename the sample to hole-2-yourName.js and push it.

## Judgement

Prises will be handed out for the most efficient implementation AND for the smallest code footprint.

## Deadline

Wed Dec 4th -- hopefully we can go out to the dub for our team meeting afterwards to talk about the problem.
